Pick one of the applications below and split it into packages. Give each application its own package under `cs201.<your username>`, but add any data structures or algorithms (like your `Sorter` class) to the `util` package.

- Sorter GUI (Assignment 4)
- Ice Cream Shop (Assignment 6)
- Postfix calculator (Lab 8)

You may not need to copy in all the `util` classes, since you already have `Stack` and `LinkedList`.
